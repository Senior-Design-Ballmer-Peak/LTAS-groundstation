# GroundStation: A Raspberry Pi-Based Communication Hub

## Overview

GroundStation is a versatile, Raspberry Pi-based communication hub designed to facilitate seamless data exchange between a ground-based application and a rocket in flight. Utilizing Bluetooth for app connectivity and radio communication for interfacing with the rocket, GroundStation aims to provide hobbyists, educators, and researchers a reliable and straightforward platform for monitoring and controlling rockets in real-time.

## Description
The ground station will allow for communication between the rocket and the mobile app durning the entire launch.

## Features

- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Easily connect your mobile or desktop application to GroundStation via Bluetooth for intuitive control and data visualization.
- **Radio Communication**: Robust radio communication link with the rocket to send commands and receive telemetry data, supporting a wide range of frequencies and protocols suitable for most amateur rocketry needs.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Process and analyze telemetry data in real-time with the Raspberry Pi, allowing for immediate feedback and control adjustments during flight.
- **Customizable Interface**: Modular codebase that can be tailored to specific project requirements, including custom telemetry parameters, control commands, and data visualization tools.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and tutorials to get you started, including setup instructions, example projects, and troubleshooting tips.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi (3B+/4 recommended)**: Acts as the central processing and communication unit.
- **Bluetooth Module**: For app connectivity. (Most Raspberry Pi models have built-in Bluetooth support.)
- **Radio Transceiver Module**: Compatible with the Raspberry Pi for rocket communication. (Specific model depends on the required range, frequency, and protocols.)
- **Power Supply**: For the Raspberry Pi and any external modules or sensors.

## Software Setup

1. **Raspberry Pi OS Installation**: Begin by installing the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS on your Raspberry Pi.

2. **Bluetooth Setup**: Configure the Raspberry Pi's built-in Bluetooth for app communication, ensuring secure and stable connections.

3. **Radio Communication Setup**: Install and configure the necessary drivers and software for your specific radio transceiver module, testing for proper communication with the rocket.

4. **Application Integration**: Set up the Bluetooth communication link between the GroundStation and your application, including data protocols and command structures.

## Usage

- **Starting the GroundStation**:
  1. Use esp32 groundstation
  2. Turn it on
  3. Connect to bluetooth

- **Rocket Communication**:
  1. Prior to launch, ensure the radio link between GroundStation and the rocket is active and stable.
  2. Use the application interface to send commands to the rocket and receive telemetry data.

- **Data Analysis & Control**:
  1. Monitor real-time data from the rocket through the application interface.
  2. Adjust rocket parameters as needed based on the received data.
